# Hi there,  It's Dau Livhalani Here ðŸ‘‹


### I am a passionate developer who enjoys not only learning but helping others. Did I mention that I am a teacher by profession too? :blush: Well I am and we are going to teach each other a lot here.

### let me not get out of the way, I am a hard worker, able to work independently as well as working in a team. You can rely on me when it comes to accomplishing any task. âš¡ Fun fact: they used to call me Madam Excecutioner at varsity, well not of people don't get it twisted :smiley: , I am someone who can be trusted and an enemy of lies.

### Most of the time I am teaching however on my free time apart from coding I write poems here and there. The lack of technological advancement in South Africa drives me to get my hands busy on project that can either improve people's lives or teach them something new.
